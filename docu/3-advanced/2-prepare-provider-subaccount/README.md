## 3. SAP NetWeaver System

If you want to test the automated data push feature from an existing SAP solution, the sample setup requires an SAP system that contains the Enterprise Procurement Model (EPM) model. The EPM is a demo application that integrates many SAP NetWeaver technologies that are used by SAP S/4HANA applications. It is based on a common business process model and follows the business object (BO) paradigm to support well-defined business logic.

In this sample application you will learn how to [push data from the EPM module to the SaaS API](../7-push-data-s4hana-system/README.md) to migrate your business data to the multitenant business application for the sustainability calculations.

You can use all **SAP S/4HANA** releases and also any other SAP systems which has an **SAP NetWeaver** stack version higher than 7.3. since these versions, all contain the EPM module by default.

> **Hint** - If you want to check your systems SAP NetWeaver version you can refer [here](https://answers.sap.com/questions/12097568/how-to-check-version-of-netweaver.html).


## 4. SAP HANA Cloud prerequisite

Make sure that you have an instance of SAP HANA Cloud in your development Space or that you share an existing SAP HANA Cloud instance with your Cloud Foundry Organization or dedicated Cloud Foundry Space (see Further Information). 

For more details see [Create an SAP HANA Database Instance Using SAP HANA Cloud Central](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hana-cloud-mission-trial-2.html).
